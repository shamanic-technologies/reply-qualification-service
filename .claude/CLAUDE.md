# Reply Qualification Service - Agent Rules

## README Maintenance (MANDATORY)

**Every time you make a meaningful change to this codebase, you MUST update README.md to reflect those changes.**

This applies when you:
- Add, modify, or remove API endpoints
- Change request/response schemas
- Add or remove environment variables
- Modify the database schema or add tables
- Change the AI model or classification categories
- Add or change npm scripts
- Update dependencies that affect the tech stack section
- Change authentication mechanisms
- Modify Docker configuration
- Change CI/CD workflows
- Add or remove test commands

### How to update the README

1. Read the current README.md first
2. Identify which sections are affected by your changes
3. Update only the relevant sections - keep it concise
4. Do NOT add sections that don't exist unless the change warrants it

### What NOT to update the README for

- Internal refactors that don't change external behavior
- Code style changes
- Test-only changes (unless test commands change)
- Dependency patch updates

## Project Conventions

- TypeScript strict mode
- Functional patterns over classes
- Express 4 for HTTP
- Drizzle ORM for database
- Vitest for testing
- Keep solutions simple - no over-engineering
