# Reply Qualification Service - Agent Rules

## README Maintenance (MANDATORY)

**Every time you make a meaningful change to this codebase, you MUST update README.md to reflect those changes.**

This applies when you:
- Add, modify, or remove API endpoints
- Change request/response schemas
- Add or remove environment variables
- Modify the database schema or add tables
- Change the AI model or classification categories
- Add or change npm scripts
- Update dependencies that affect the tech stack section
- Change authentication mechanisms
- Modify Docker configuration
- Change CI/CD workflows
- Add or remove test commands

### How to update the README

1. Read the current README.md first
2. Identify which sections are affected by your changes
3. Update only the relevant sections - keep it concise
4. Do NOT add sections that don't exist unless the change warrants it

### What NOT to update the README for

- Internal refactors that don't change external behavior
- Code style changes
- Test-only changes (unless test commands change)
- Dependency patch updates

## Regression Tests (MANDATORY)

**Every time you fix a bug or resolve an issue, you MUST create a regression test that:**

1. **Reproduces the original bug** — write a test that would FAIL on the old code
2. **Passes with the fix** — confirm the test passes after your changes
3. **Lives in the right place:**
   - Unit tests → `tests/unit/<module>.test.ts`
   - Integration tests → `tests/integration/<feature>.test.ts`
4. **Uses a clear name** — prefix with `regression:` or describe the issue, e.g.:
   ```
   it("regression: should not crash when reply body is empty", ...)
   ```

### When this applies

- Every bugfix
- Every issue resolution (even if it's a config/schema change — test the expected behavior)
- Edge cases discovered during development

### When this does NOT apply

- Pure refactors with no behavior change
- README/docs-only changes
- Dependency updates with no code changes

### CI enforcement

All tests run in CI via `npm run test:unit` and `npm run test:integration`. If your fix doesn't have a corresponding test, the PR should not be considered complete.

## Project Conventions

- TypeScript strict mode
- Functional patterns over classes
- Express 4 for HTTP
- Drizzle ORM for database
- Vitest for testing
- Keep solutions simple - no over-engineering
